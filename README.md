# social-network-API-mongoDB
setting up an API that uses mongoDB to store data

## Description

This application uses MongoDB as a database for a social media site.  This application only includes the backend and has restful routes for adding user, friends, thoughts (post), and reactions (comments).  The main purpose of creating this was to get familiar with MongoDB.

## Installation

1.  Download the files from this repository
2.  At the root of the application, run "npm install" to install all the required packages

## Usage

To launch the application, run the following command from the root of the application: node server.js

This will launch the application and it will listen on http://localhost:3001.  Once the application is listening, REST API calls can be made to interact with the data.  A link is below that shows how to launch the application and make REST API calls.
